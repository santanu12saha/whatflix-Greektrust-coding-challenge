# whatflix-Greektrust-coding-challenge
A restful web service implementation of building a movie recommendation system using Apache Lucence. Apache Lucence is a high-performance, full-featured text search engine library written entirely in Java. Also we can use other search technologies stack like elastic search (very famous for distributed environment) and Apache solr to make the same. The project included  centralized cache mechanism for storing user preference data. Technology stack uses Jersey, Apache Lucence, Jackson, Google guava and so on. 

Build a Restful web service API which will accept a search string and userID and return unique movies in the order of preference for that user.
